## HOTSEAT
The buttons have to be switched on before the app starts working.
 Potentiometer acts as temperature sensor. It gives signal which is converted by ADC and used to make a PWM signal pf corresponding duty cycle, as seen in the oscilloscope. 
 As potentiometer is varied, message containing detected temperature is shown in serial monitor.
