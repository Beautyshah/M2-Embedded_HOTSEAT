# M2-Embedded_HOTSEAT
## HOTSEAT
The buttons have to be switched on before the app starts working.
 Potentiometer acts as temperature sensor. It gives signal which is converted by ADC and used to make a PWM signal pf corresponding duty cycle, as seen in the oscilloscope. 
 As potentiometer is varied, message containing detected temperature is shown in serial monitor.

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome
| No. | Challenge | Solution
|-----|-----------|--------
|1. | On the simulide latest version some sources are not available| By the help of connect class solved |
|2. | issues in implementation | fixed them by making template in order
|3. | Issues in workflows | fixed them by updating the path to all files correctly
